# AI Coding Assistant Session Summary

## Current Context Management Strategy
- **Context Window**: ~100K tokens (approaching limit)
- **Priority**: Implement context optimization and management
- **Goal**: Continue productive development with efficient token usage

## Key Technical Observations
1. **Project Structure**: AI-powered accounting application with Dart
2. **Architecture**: Multiple MCP servers for accounting operations
3. **Dependencies**: DeepSeek AI integration, professional accounting features
4. **Current Focus**: Code analysis and architectural improvements

## Immediate Action Plan
1. Create context management system
2. Implement session persistence
3. Develop crash recovery mechanism
4. Optimize token usage through summarization

## Technical Debt Identified
- Need for better context window management
- Session persistence requirements
- Crash recovery mechanisms
- Token optimization strategies

## Next Development Steps
1. Implement recursive self-improvement system
2. Create MCP server for local system access
3. Develop context summarization tools
4. Build todo list for session continuity
